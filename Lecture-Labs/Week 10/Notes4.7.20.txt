A condition variable is a synchronization object
that lets threads wait efficiently

Never us semaphores with Anderson and Dahlin

Concurrent code is packaged as shared objects

Method, part 1: class design
Identify classes
Define interfaces, and identify state variables
Implement methods

Method, part 2: multi-threades case
add a single lock
add code to acquire and release the lock
add zero or more condition vairables
add wait calls within loops
add signal and broadcast calls

One wait list for condition variables, seperate waiting
lists

Always signal when the lock is held

1. Surround code that accesses shared data with
lock/unlock

2. After modifying shared data, signal if other
threads might want to know about it.

3. The teacher talks to fast
