Every process				|
has own V address			|

Bound is the whole			|
size of the virtual			|
memory space				|

	wasted space will be mapped 	|
	used on physical memory		|

paging is splitting its v memory	|
to the physical memory.			|

Segmentation is virtual memory that is 	|
broken up. Like a different array lists |
for its process.			|


Physical address = x(virtual space) +
				 base


ip addresses fitting into a subnet?
