designing file structure
	files have:
		inode #
		metadata
		content
	
	directories have:
		inode #
		(name, inode #) pairs

You need to be able to find the root directory

inode will capture file metadata and location of 
the file's data blocks

Need to track which data blocks and inodes are being used
	Use bitmaps
		each bit tracks 1 item
		0 = free, 1 = used
	With 1 block we can track 32K items
	Use 1 block for inode bitmap, 1 for data bitmap

Where is the actual content withing files stored?
	In data blocks

The inode number (i-number) tell us where the inode is located

What is stored in the blocked inode number?
	inode bitmap
