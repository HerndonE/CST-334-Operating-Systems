Two part exam
 part 1: short questions 20-30mins 10-15?
 part 2: longer questions 45 minutes

Process Management Review
	Main goal: virtualize the CPU
	Make it so programs are not aware that CPU is being shared
	
How to avoid excess overheard
	Let processes run directly on the CPU

How to keep limit processes control over the hardware?
	hardware user/kernal mode
	hardware software interrupts


When certain hardware events occur, the CPU:
	Stops the current process, save its registers, enters
		kernal mode

	Locates an interrupt handler in the OS trap table; the OS
		runs it

Scheduling algorithms

Scheduling ciritera

Which scheduling process has the
lowest average response time?
	 -round robin

Memory Management
	main goal: virtualize memory
	Each process gets its own virtual address space

	Main technical problems:
		how to do address translation quickly
		....

2 homeworks will be dropped

Concurrency
	Main goal:
		mutually exclusive access to critical sections
		avoid deadlocks
		processes wait efficiently

	Synchronization primitives
		Locks, conditions variables, semaphores
