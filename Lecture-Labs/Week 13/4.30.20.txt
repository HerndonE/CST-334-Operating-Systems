Possible fixes for HW 11 awk 
	
Dr. Bruns in the Zoom meeting assumed
that the folks that pass the tests provide and not
his personal tests that just put code together willy nilly
and doesn't care about the problem at hand
"as a software engineer..." Not everyone is a software engineer


Hard Drive attributes
	Actuator
	Actuator arms
	Head 
	Platter

In early disk interfaces, "CHS addressing":
	Cylinder
	Head
	Sector

Reading/Writing of a drive involves 3 steps:
1. Wait for the sector to rotate underneath head (rotational delay) -5 ms
2. Move the head to the right track (seek) - 5 ms
3. actually transfer the data (transfer)

Average rotational delay
8.3 ms/rev

Drive performance will depend a lot on how the drive is used

Random workload:
	read 32KB from each of 100 locations

Sequential workload:
	read 3.2MB sequentially

File API
	creating a file: open()
	reading/writing: read(),write()
	writing immediately: fsync()
	renaming: rename()
	getting status: stat(),fstat()
	deleting: unlink() - deletes a name from the filesystem

A physical disk can be subdivided into partitions

Sometimes volume is used for a partition on which a file
system has been created.

A related idea is logical volume, which could be p art of a drive
